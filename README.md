# Road Traffic Stop Data Analysis
This project analyzes traffic stop data to uncover patterns in driver demographics, violations, search behavior, and stop durations. It uses Python and pandas for data manipulation, with visualizations powered by seaborn and matplotlib.

# Dataset Overview
The dataset includes detailed records of police traffic stops with the following columns:

stop_date: Date of the stop

stop_time: Time of the stop

driver_gender: Gender of the driver

driver_age: Age of the driver

driver_race: Race of the driver

violation: Reason for the stop (e.g., Speeding, Equipment)

search_conducted: Whether a search was conducted

stop_outcome: Result of the stop (e.g., Citation, Arrest)

stop_duration: Estimated duration of the stop

drugs_related_stop: Boolean indicating drug-related stops

# Key Questions Explored
Are men or women stopped more often for speeding?

Does gender affect the likelihood of being searched?

What is the average stop duration?

How does driver age vary across different types of violations?

Which violations are most common?

# Technologies Used
Python 

pandas

numpy

seaborn

matplotlib

# Sample Insights
Men are stopped for speeding more than twice as often as women.

Searches are more frequently conducted on male drivers.

The average stop duration is approximately 12.19 minutes.

Drivers stopped for moving violations tend to be older than those stopped for equipment violations or speeding.
